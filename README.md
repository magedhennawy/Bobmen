## Description of Web App

A dashboard web app that functions as a user's homepage.

It would serve as an all-in-one productivity app/dashboard that would have widget or modules such as: 
        - Calender
        - To do list
        - Reminders
        - Emails
        - Weather 
        - Passwords Saver
        - More feature to come

This app will provide users with the office necessities that would usually require many tabs open.

## Key features that will be completed by the Beta version

User accounts: 
    - Users can save the widgets that they would like to have shown, so every time they access the dashboard, it is the same way they left it
    - User location saved for weather
    - Password saver hashed and saved in case they require their passwords
    - User reminders saved
    - emails still active
    - sends notification when a reminder is up
