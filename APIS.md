# Bobboard: APIS

## APIS:

### TWITTER:

Twitter uses Auth to log in, so we need a redirection link, to allow users to log into their twitter account, to allow
Bobboard to have permission to access the user's feed.

link here: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only

After that, the api calls and documentation to get the statuses, and user timelines, are provided here:  https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/timelines

but before all of that. we need to create an app, and get an api key: https://apps.twitter.com/ (PLEASE CALL IT BOBBOARD :) )
